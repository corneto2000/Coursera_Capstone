For people shifting to completely new State/Country,it is often a problem finding a good place to settle down at.
Making a wrong decision could lead to a lot of problems. At this time, it is useful, if the person had some knowledge
about the nearby neighborhoods, venues, trendy places etc.. which suit their taste, thus helping them in their decision of
finding the right neighborhood to settle down in.
In this project, we look into the neighborhoods of one of the most trending places in the US, New Orleans. For a person who's completely 
new to the place, it would be difficult to find out information about nearby facilities and venues, which would suit him the best, and this 
project aims at providing, not just for New Orleans , but for any place in the world, a descriptive outlook of each Neighborhood,
which will help the person in settling down.
