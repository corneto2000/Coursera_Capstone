For this project, I have used The neighborhood data of New Orleans from the following wikipedia page:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighborhoods_in_New_Orleans

This page consists of a table with the neighborhoods of New Orleans and their respective coordinates, and further in the notebook,
we access the Nearby venues of a given coordinate using Foursquare API.
